<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I’m [SHARON JOSEPH], and I’m a STUDENT (WED DEVELOPER)

  I’ve been LEARNING for a while now, and it’s become an integral part of my life. My passion for WEBSITES started when I was in 2YEAR OF MY ENGG . I got a LAPTOP and SOURCE CODE EDITOR  and CODE DOWN everything that popped into my head—I couldn’t stop!
  
  As my CODING skills improved, so did my confidence as a WEB DEVELOPER. At first, people thought I was just a TEEN with a lot of energy; but now they see that CODING is more than just something fun to do—it’s something that makes me happy, and gives me clarity on THAT I CAN GET JOB, and helps me make sense of the world around me.
  
  So if you’re interested in hiring me as your WEB DEVELOPER or if you have any questions about what it’s like to work with me, please feel free to reach out!
